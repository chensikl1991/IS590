They work like a list or array except that their indexes (called \"keys\") can be arbitrary values that aren't necessarily integers. Also, the indexes don't have to be consecutive in any sense, and can even vary data types. Dictionaries turn out to be very handy for many common situations in coding. They are also generally fast in most operations, and efficient in storage.\n",
